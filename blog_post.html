title: "Does home advantage really matter during Fifa World Cups?"
header-img: "img/football.jpeg"
---

<p>Since I am a passionate football fan, I really enjoy taking looks at all different kinds of tables: local leagues, European champions competitions, 
    continental and international tournaments like the UEFA EURO or FIFA world cup. The other day I discovered the All-time table of the FIFA World Cup. 
    I instantly wondered what would happen, if you take different points of view e.g. subtract the home advantage, see if the continent where the 
    tournament is played matters or create a new All-time table which includes scores from continental championships, qualification and friendly 
    matches.
</p>
<p>In the following I will answer the following questions: </p>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Do hosting countries have a higher probability of winning games than other participating countries due to home advantage?</li>
            <li>How does the all-time table change if you extract the games with home advantage?</li>
            <li>Which larger active tournament has the highest avg. goals per game?</li>
        </ol>

<p>Growing up surrounded by fields and forest on all sides with an Environmental Police Officer for a father and an Elementary Science Program Developer for a mother... let's just say I know my foliage. I love our planet and firmly believe that if I can do anything during my time here to help preserve it, it would be an enormous victory for me.</p>


<h3>Technology</h3>

<p>I'm always fascinated by the inner workings and various applications of the new technology that the millennial generation has grown up alongside. Every time a new gadget comes out, I want to read about it. Lately, I love spending my free time sitting in front of the PS4 slaying mad dragons.</p>

<p>Coding had always been something I was hesitant to delve into, however I've found that there truly is potential here for me to do something with my life that I hold a true passion for. Of course there are other things I'm passionate about too! Honorable Mentions: Snowboarding, Cooking, Reading, Soccer, Running, and my cat (though if she knew she only made honorable mention there would be hell to pay so mum's the word!)</p> -->
