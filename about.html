<p>I was born in the United States and raised and educated in Germany. My work in Sales and Business Development with several German export and IT companies has taken me to Bogata, Arequipa, Santiago de Chile, Rio de Janerio, Miami and now back to Berlin, Germany.

I am fluent in German, English, Spanish and Portuguese.</p>


<h3>Some words about my background:</h3>

<p>I studied a dual business bachelor and worked some years for german trading companies in Latin America. The last two years I had my own business in Miami, FL importing and distributing gourmet food products.

During the last few years, I have been working in different countries and travelling to interesting places all over the world as a trainee, an expatriate and then as an entrepreneur in the USA. Being multilingual helped during these assignments, and I even had the opportunity to learn more languages on my journeys.

I always had ideas to build and improve new products, but I had a lack of technical knowledge to actually code them. Hence, I decided to sign up in LeWagon, one of the leading coding bootcamps worldwide.

I am proficient in Ruby and Ruby on Rails, building smart web applications in a team during and as personal projects after the bootcamp. I also have experience using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript ,and with database technologies, such as MySQL and PostgreSQL.</p>

<p>Growing up surrounded by fields and forest on all sides with an Environmental Police Officer for a father and an Elementary Science Program Developer for a mother... let's just say I know my foliage. I love our planet and firmly believe that if I can do anything during my time here to help preserve it, it would be an enormous victory for me.</p>


<h3>Technology</h3>

<p>I'm always fascinated by the inner workings and various applications of the new technology that the millennial generation has grown up alongside. Every time a new gadget comes out, I want to read about it. Lately, I love spending my free time sitting in front of the PS4 slaying mad dragons.</p>

<p>Coding had always been something I was hesitant to delve into, however I've found that there truly is potential here for me to do something with my life that I hold a true passion for. Of course there are other things I'm passionate about too! Honorable Mentions: Snowboarding, Cooking, Reading, Soccer, Running, and my cat (though if she knew she only made honorable mention there would be hell to pay so mum's the word!)</p> -->
