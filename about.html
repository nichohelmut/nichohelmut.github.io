<p>I was born in the United States and raised and educated in Germany. My work in Sales and Business Development with several German export and IT companies has taken me to Bogata, Arequipa, Santiago de Chile, Rio de Janerio, Miami and now back to Berlin, Germany.

I am fluent in German, English, Spanish and Portuguese.</p>

<p>So what is it I enjoy? My entire life I've had three big passions:</p>
<h3>The Performing Arts</h3>

<p>Ever since I can remember I've been participating in theatre groups around the community. I love to sing and will do so often.</p>

<h3>The Environment</h3>

<p>Growing up surrounded by fields and forest on all sides with an Environmental Police Officer for a father and an Elementary Science Program Developer for a mother... let's just say I know my foliage. I love our planet and firmly believe that if I can do anything during my time here to help preserve it, it would be an enormous victory for me.</p>


<h3>Technology</h3>

<p>I'm always fascinated by the inner workings and various applications of the new technology that the millennial generation has grown up alongside. Every time a new gadget comes out, I want to read about it. Lately, I love spending my free time sitting in front of the PS4 slaying mad dragons.</p>

<p>Coding had always been something I was hesitant to delve into, however I've found that there truly is potential here for me to do something with my life that I hold a true passion for. Of course there are other things I'm passionate about too! Honorable Mentions: Snowboarding, Cooking, Reading, Soccer, Running, and my cat (though if she knew she only made honorable mention there would be hell to pay so mum's the word!)</p>

<h3>Thanks For Reading!</h3>
